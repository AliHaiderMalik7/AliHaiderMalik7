## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m **Ali Haider**, a Senior Full-Stack Developer with **8+ years of experience** delivering scalable, high-performance web applications for real-world business use cases. I’ve worked across **SaaS, CRM, e-commerce, travel & booking, shipping, construction, property, and event-based platforms**, helping teams move from idea to production-ready systems.

I specialize in **MERN and MEAN stacks, Django-based backends, and modern React frontends**, building secure APIs, modular microservices, and intuitive user interfaces. My focus is always on performance, scalability, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability.

I have strong experience in **GIS and location-based solutions**, integrating **ArcGIS and Map APIs** to build tracking, visualization, and geospatial analytics systems.

Alongside full-stack development, I actively build **AI-powered applications**, including **Conversational AI, intelligent agents, and RAG-based systems**, enabling automation and smarter user experiences within SaaS products.

I also manage **cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines** on AWS, DigitalOcean, and GCP, ensuring reliable deployments and scalable production environments. I enjoy working in cross-functional teams and translating complex business requirements into robust technical solutions.
